                <p class="text-[12px]  md:text-[18px] "> The European Council and European Parliament Regulation (EU)
                    2019/2088 (“SFDR” or the “Disclosure Regulation”), seeks to establish a pan-European framework to
                    facilitate Sustainable Investment. The Disclosure Regulation provides for a harmonised approach in
                    respect of sustainability-related disclosures to investors within the EEA's financial services sector.
                    In the absence of such harmonisation, individual EU Member States would be free to adopt divergent
                    disclosure standards or develop different approaches, resulting in an uneven playing field and/or
                    creating barriers to entry for asset managers looking to make available financial products within the
                    internal market of the European Union.
                    The scope of the Disclosure Regulation is extremely broad, covering a very wide range of financial
                    products and financial market participants. It seeks to achieve more transparency regarding how
                    financial market participants integrate Sustainability Risks into their investment decisions and
                    consideration of adverse sustainability impacts in the investment process. Its objectives are to:
                <ul>
                    <li> strengthen protection for investors of financial products;</li>
                    <li>
                        improve the disclosures made available to investors from financial market participants; and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        improve the disclosures made available to investors regarding the financial products, to amongst
                        other things, enable investors make informed investment decisions.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                For the purposes of the Disclosure Regulation, FNX Dublin Limited meets the criteria of a financial
                market participant.
                This document fulfils the disclosure requirements under Articles 3, 4 and 5 of SFDR for SAMI as a
                financial market participant.
                In accordance with Article 3 of the SFDR, financial market participants are required to publish
                information on their strategies for integrating sustainability risks in their investment decision-making
                processes on their websites.
                In accordance with Article 4 (1) of the SFDR, financial market participants shall make a statement on
                due diligence strategies related to the main adverse sustainability impacts of investment decisions on
                sustainability factors.
                Furthermore, in accordance with Article 5 (1) of the SFDR, financial market participants shall include
                in their remuneration policies information on how those policies are consistent with the integration of
                sustainability risks and shall publish that information on their websites.
